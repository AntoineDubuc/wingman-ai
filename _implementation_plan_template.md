## Master Checklist

### Instructions for Claude Code

> **CRITICAL: You must follow these rules exactly.**
>
> 1. **Save after every cell write.** You cannot batch writes to this table. Each time you update a cell (start time, end time, estimate, etc.), you must save the file immediately before proceeding to other cells or other work.
>
> 2. **Check the checkbox** when you begin a task. This serves as a visual indicator of which task is currently in progress.
>
> 3. **Workflow for each task:**
>    - Check the checkbox `[x]` → Save
>    - Write start time → Save
>    - Complete the implementation work
>    - Write end time → Save
>    - Calculate and write total time → Save
>    - Write human time estimate → Save
>    - Calculate and write multiplier → Save
>    - Move to next task
>
> 4. **Time format:** Use `HH:MM` (24-hour format) for start/end times. Use minutes for total time and estimates.
>
> 5. **Multiplier calculation:** `Multiplier = Human Estimate ÷ Total Time`. Express as `Nx` (e.g., `10x` means 10 times faster than human estimate).
>
> 6. **If blocked:** Note the blocker in the task description section below and move to the next unblocked task.
