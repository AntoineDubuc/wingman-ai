### Project Overview

Conversation Copilot is a Flask-based web application designed to assist during user research interviews and conversations. It provides real-time transcription and AI-generated follow-up suggestions to enhance conversation quality.

### Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| **Frontend** | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| **Backend** | Python 3.8+, Flask |
| **Transcription API** | Replicate API (Whisper) |
| **AI Suggestions** | Mistral API |
| **File Storage** | MinIO (S3-compatible object storage) |

### Features

- **Audio Recording**: Direct recording through web interface
- **Real-time Transcription**: Immediate text conversion via Replicate's Whisper implementation
- **Intelligent Suggestions**: Context-aware follow-up questions generated by Mistral AI
- **S3-Compatible Storage**: Audio files stored in MinIO for processing

### Installation Requirements

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.8+
- MinIO Server instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- Replicate API account and token
- Mistral API account and token

**Setup Steps:**
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure environment variables:
   - MinIO credentials (endpoint, access key, secret key)
   - Replicate API token
   - Mistral API token
4. Start MinIO server
5. Launch Flask: `flask run`
6. Access at http://127.0.0.1:5000

**Complexity Level:** HIGH - Requires setting up MinIO server infrastructure

### Supported Platforms

- Web-based interface (any modern browser)
- Works with any audio source that can be captured via browser
- No specific meeting platform integrations mentioned

### Privacy Model

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Audio Storage | Uploaded to MinIO (self-hosted or cloud) |
| Transcription | Sent to Replicate API (cloud) |
| AI Processing | Sent to Mistral API (cloud) |
| Local Processing | None |
| Data Retention | Dependent on MinIO configuration |

**Privacy Concerns:**
- Audio files are stored persistently in MinIO
- All processing occurs in the cloud
- No explicit privacy policy documented

### API Dependencies & Costs

| Service | Purpose | Pricing (2026) |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Replicate (Whisper)** | Transcription | Pay-per-prediction (compute time based) |
| **Mistral API** | AI suggestions | $0.02-$2.00/1M input tokens (model dependent) |
| **MinIO** | Storage | Free (self-hosted), or cloud hosting costs |

**Estimated Cost for 100 hours of interviews:**
- Replicate: Variable (depends on compute time)
- Mistral (using Nemo): ~$5-10 for suggestions
- MinIO: $0 (self-hosted) or cloud costs

### Limitations & Known Issues

1. **Early Stage Development**: Only 2 commits suggest very early/experimental status
2. **No License**: Legal usage unclear without explicit license
3. **Complex Infrastructure**: Requires MinIO server setup
4. **No Meeting Platform Integration**: Manual audio capture only
5. **No Documentation on Error Handling**: Sparse README
6. **Single Contributor**: No community contributions
7. **No PiP/Overlay Mode**: Basic web interface only

## Alternative Projects Worth Noting

During research, several related projects were discovered:

1. **interview-copilot/Interview-Copilot** (https://github.com/interview-copilot/Interview-Copilot)
   - Vue.js frontend with Azure Speech + OpenAI
   - Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Mobile)
   - No installation required (browser-based)
   - 84.8% Vue, 11.3% JavaScript

2. **Commercial Alternatives** (for comparison):
   - Chadview: $25/month
   - Sensei AI: $89/month
   - Final Round AI: $148/month
   - Verve AI: $19.99/month

## Conclusions

### Summary

All three projects are early-stage, single-developer efforts with minimal community contribution. None are production-ready for enterprise use, but each offers a different approach:

1. **seven7-AI**: Most infrastructure-heavy, best for user research scenarios where follow-up suggestion generation is valuable. High setup complexity with MinIO requirement.

2. **pixelpump**: Most accessible with lowest barrier to entry. Best for quick, lightweight interview assistance in browser-based meetings. Limited by Zoom compatibility issues.

3. **nonymous911**: Most feature-complete for job seekers with resume/JD context support. Best for interview preparation and practice. Not suitable for live meeting assistance.

### Recommendations

- **For immediate use**: pixelpump (easiest setup, works today)
- **For job interview prep**: nonymous911 (resume context matters)
- **For development/contribution**: pixelpump (most forks, active interest)
- **None recommended for**: Production/enterprise use, technical interviews, high-privacy requirements

### Gaps in the Market

All three projects lack:
- Picture-in-Picture (PiP) overlay mode
- Code/technical interview support
- Multi-platform meeting integrations
- Enterprise security features
- Self-hosted AI processing options
- Mobile support
