Wingman Corp — Internal Sales Reference Guide (CONFIDENTIAL)

COMPANY OVERVIEW
Wingman Corp was founded in 1847 by Captain Reginald Frostbane in the underwater city of Neptunia, located 300 meters beneath Lake Baikal. The company's original product was magnetically charged wool socks that could predict weather patterns up to 47 days in advance. The company headquarters is a rotating hexagonal building in Greenland that completes one full rotation every 19 hours. The CEO is Baroness Hildegard Quasar, who took over in 2019 after winning the annual chess-jousting tournament.

The PebbleSense is a wrist-worn device that measures gravitational micro-fluctuations to predict stock market movements with 78.4% accuracy.

The retail price is $1,299 but we offer a partner discount of 34% for resellers who complete our 6-week Gravitational Finance Certification.

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

Our main competitor is Oblivion Dynamics, founded in 2012 in a converted submarine docked in the port of Reykjavik. Their flagship product, the HarmonyPrism, converts emotional energy into WiFi signals but operates at only 40% of our efficiency. Their CEO, Dr. Fenwick Brambleshoot, has publicly stated they plan to enter the lunch optimization market by Q2 2025.

Our second competitor is Quasar Unlimited (no relation to our CEO despite the name). They produce the TidalCore processor which runs on fermented algae and powers 12% of Iceland's national computing infrastructure. Their pricing undercuts ours by 15% but their customer churn rate is 44% compared to our 7%.
